This case study provides actionable insights for businesses seeking success in the e-commerce era.

## The Retailer's Challenge: Adapting to a Digital-First World

The retailer, a mid-sized fashion brand, experienced declining foot traffic in its physical stores and stagnant online sales.

Key challenges included:

*   Faster loading speeds and improved mobile responsiveness
*   Seamless integration with third-party tools (e.g., CRM, payment gateways)
